pure prompt madness

### vision: an app to gamify tracking steps.

### how do we gamify? what do we want?

we allow you to have friends, and you can track steps across friends.
you can track the distance youve walked on a map
e.g ~180,000 steps gets you from Amherst, MA to Boston, MA

you can not only compete with your friends, you can also accumulate your steps
as a group to reach x location.

### todos!!!

#### todo: look sexy

- [ ] auth: use google sign in
- [ ] user profile stored in supabase
- [ ] friend groups stored in supabase
- [ ] steps - gotten from health connect / apple health
- [ ] integrate map into project (google maps)
- [ ] calculating distance as the crow flies (keep it easy for now)
- [ ] groups of friends vs groups of friends
