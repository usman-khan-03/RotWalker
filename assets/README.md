# Assets

This directory should contain the following assets for the app:

## Required Assets

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1242x2436px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

## Creating Assets

You can use any image editor or online tools to create these assets. For now, you can use placeholder images or generate them using tools like:

- [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/)
- [Expo Asset Generator](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/app-icons/)

The app will work without these assets, but they're required for production builds.
